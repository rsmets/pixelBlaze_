/*
  Sound - rays

  This pattern is designed to use the sensor expansion board, but falls back to
  simulated sound data if the sensor board isn't detected.

  The beginning of the strip will originate pixels with color based on the most
  prevalent frequency in the sound, and brightness based on the magnitude. Those
  rays of color will then travel down the strip.

  Please check out the "sound - blink fade" pattern for more verbose comments
  explaining the PI controller used below for automatic gain control.
