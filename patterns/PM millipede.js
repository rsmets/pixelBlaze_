/*
  Millipede

  There's something mesmerizing about the waves that travel along a millipede's
  feet. This pattern's combination of wave()s and a remainder seems to capture
  a similar motion.

  Regarding the order of operations, remainder has the same precedence as
  multiplication and division, so `a * b / c % d * e` happens left-to-right.
